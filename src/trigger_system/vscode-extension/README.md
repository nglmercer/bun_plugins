# Trigger System VS Code Extension

Official VS Code extension for the **Agnostic Trigger System**. This extension provides rich language support for YAML-based trigger rules, making it easier to build, debug, and maintain complex event-driven logic.

## Features

### 🔍 Real-time Validation

- Deep schema validation using **ArkType**.
- Highlight missing required fields (like `id`, `on`, `do`).

### ⌨️ Smart Autocompletion

- Suggestions for core operators: `on`, `if`, `do`, `when`.
- Context-aware completions for condition operators (e.g., `EQ`, `GT`, `MATCHES`).
- Suggestions for schema keys and common values.

### ℹ️ Hover Documentation

- Detailed descriptions for every field in the rule schema.
- Instant access to documentation for operators and action types.

### 🎯 Data Context & Templates

- Intelligent suggestions for template variables (e.g., `${data.percentage}`).
- Previews of variable values from your data source.

### 🛠️ Directive Support

- Control the linter with comments:
  - `# @disable-lint`: Disable all diagnostics for a file.
  - `# @disable-rule <id>`: Disable a specific validation rule.
